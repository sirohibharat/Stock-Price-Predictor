## Stock Price Prediction

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance and Analysis

The model was intentionally built in two stages to demonstrate a core concept in time-series forecasting: **problem transformation**.

### Stage 1: Naive Price Prediction (The "Why")

An initial model was built to predict the absolute stock price directly. This model performed poorly, yielding a **negative R-squared of -0.3179** and a high **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of â‚¹105.73**. This highlighted the classic pitfall of using a non-stationary time series as a target, where the model fails to generalize from past price levels to future price levels.

### Stage 2: Robust Return Prediction (The Solution)

To address this, the problem was reformulated to predict the **daily percentage return**, which is a more stationary target. The features were also re-engineered to be relative to previous price levels.

This improved model produced the following results when evaluated on the predicted prices:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): `â‚¹13.95`**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): `â‚¹18.84`**
- **R-squared (RÂ²) on Returns: `-0.2349`**

**Analysis:**
- The MAE was successfully reduced by **over 87%**, showing a dramatic improvement in price prediction accuracy.
- The low RÂ² on returns is an expected outcome that confirms the difficulty of predicting the noisy, near-random movements of the stock market.
- The success of the MAE and RMSE proves that by focusing on predicting stationary returns, we can build a model that accurately reconstructs the price path.
